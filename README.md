Did ZIP codes with lower socioeconomic status experience higher COVID-19 rates? 
Low socioeconomic status is proxied by low income and high rates of drug related EMS calls. I use NYC EMS dispatch and U.S. Census data on a Linux system with Gawk, Emacs, and Git. Data visualizations reveal consistent linear correlations, supporting my hypothesis.
